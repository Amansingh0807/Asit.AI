# 🎓 AI-Based Personalized Curriculum Platform

## 🚩 Problem that every Student face : 

The current education system follows a rigid, standardized curriculum that assumes every student learns at the same pace and in the same way. However, the reality is vastly different — students vary in their learning speed, interests, subject preferences, and future career goals. This mismatch leads to:

- 📉 Learning gaps in subjects where students face difficulty.  
- 😓 Academic stress from subjects that don't align with their goals.  
- ❌ Lack of engagement due to one-size-fits-all content.  
- 🕒 Inefficient time utilization, as equal effort is expected across all subjects, even those already mastered.  
- 🤐 Isolation and self-doubt due to the absence of peer interaction and live guidance.  
- ⚠️ Cheating and lack of seriousness during online tests due to limited evaluation control.

As a result, students struggle with motivation, fall behind in specific areas, and are unable to reach their full potential due to the lack of personalization, flexibility, and real-time support.
